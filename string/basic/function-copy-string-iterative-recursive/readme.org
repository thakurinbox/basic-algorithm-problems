** Function to copy string (Iterative and Recursive)
- Given two strings, copy one string to other using recursion. So the problem
  statement is very clear but still there are assumptions. I am considering it
  as a algorithm problem where we need to test our recursion knowledge.
- In the original problem statment it needs to be done in iterative and
  recursive way. I have provided the recursive solution. I know you can
  manupulate it and have the iterative solution.
- I am not handling the strings globally. that can be done as i said I just
  tried to test recursive knowledge here.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Input :  s1 = "hello there whats up"
         s2 = ""
Output : s2 = "hello there whats up"
 #+END_SRC
